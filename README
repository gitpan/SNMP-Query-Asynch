SNMP-Query-Asynch

VERSION 

  0.01

DESCRIPTION

This module allows for a fairly simple, streamlined means of executing large
numbers of SNMP operations as fast as your systems can handle. It extensively
uses net-snmp's asynchronous operation interfaces and callbacks to keep as much
data flowing as you need. 

Perl's support of closures and anonymous subroutines provide the means for 
sophisticated, elegant control of query operations before and after execution. 
There are also facilities to install callbacks that are run after pre-set 
numbers (batches) of operations are completed . 

These callbacks can be used to log progress, update the user, transfer results
from memory to disk (or even another thread or process!) or anything you can
think of! If there's some feature you desire, do not hesitate to ask me!!!

Please be aware - my primary design concern is speed and flexibility. I have 
certain non-scientific, subjective benchmarks I use to decide if some 
modification is worth-while, but so far the design of the internals of this 
module has lent itself to feature additions and enhancements very well.
